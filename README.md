# Minigrid
Responsive and lightweight CSS grid

## Installation
Simply include `minigrid.min.css` into your website.

## Usage 
```
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-3">
      <!-- This content will take up 3/12 (or 1/4) of the container -->
    </div>
    <div class="col-3">
      <!-- This content will take up 3/12 (or 1/4) of the container -->
    </div>
    <div class="col-6">
      <!-- This content will take up 6/12 (or 1/2) of the container -->
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
### Creating grids
Simply state the number of columns you want your content to occupy in the `.col` class.
For example, if you want your content to take up 8 columns (out of 12), simply give your content the class `.col-8`.

### Preserving grids on mobile
Minigrid is built mobile first, so all columns will expand to the full container width on smaller screens. If you donâ€™t want columns to expand on mobile devices and small screens, simply add -sm to the end of your column class name.
For example, if you want to have two blocks of content floating side-by-side on small screens, each would be given the class name `.col-6-sm`.

### Positioning
simply give your content the `.left`, `.right`, `.center` or `.justify` class to position your content.
